# Development Tasks

## Current Objectives

1.  Modify login logic to add retry mechanism

## Task Details

### Login Enhancement Requirements

*   Add retry mechanism to existing login logic
*   Pending implementation details:
    *   Number of retry attempts
    *   Delay between retries
    *   Error handling strategy
    *   User feedback during retry process

### Development Environment

*   Working Directory: h:/code\XXXXXX/

### Next Steps

1.  Locate existing login implementation
2.  Define retry mechanism specifications:
    *   Maximum retry attempts
    *   Retry interval
    *   Error handling approach
3.  Implement retry logic
4.  Test enhanced login system

### Notes

*   Further details needed for login implementation location
*   Specific retry mechanism parameters to be determined
